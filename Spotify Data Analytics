--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--I then created a table to insert the data into.
--Finally, I analyzed the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );
--After creating the table I inserted the Spotify csv file.
--Here are the questions I asked and answered:

--How many songs were sung by Olivia Rodrigo and what are the songs called?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--What artist released the longest song?
SELECT MAX(duration_ms), artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT  popularity, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY danceability
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
